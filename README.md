# Constant pH MD Analysis

This branch contains analysis scripts and data for simulations performed using Constant pH Molecular Dynamics (CpHMD). It includes:

- **Lambda coordinate analysis**: Tracks protonation state changes over time.
- **Atomic trajectory analysis**: RMSD, RMSF, and Radius of Gyration calculations to assess structural dynamics.

It is useful for studying pH-dependent conformational changes and protonation-coupled motions.
